# running linux on the aero 15X laptop

This is high end laptop released from Gigabyte in late 2017 with the Intel i7-7700HQ (4 core)
It features big battery, thin body and a maxQ 1070 GTX GPU. 

It boots pretty nicely with ubuntu 16.04.3 (using the hwe 4.10 kernel) with the wifi card, keyboard,
and sound working out of the box. It boots to the graphical display also without problems.

### Update 7/10/2022   Xubuntu 22.04 awesomeness
Updated to Xubuntu 22.04 LTS with secure boot, linux kernel 5.15.0, 
after installing fresh to / (holding home to install latest driver did
```
sudo ubuntu-drivers install nvidia:515
sudo apt install mate-optimus ecryptfs-utils keychain network-manager-openconnect
# network-manager-openconnect-gnome
```

And everything works with my previously installed machine learning code using pytorch 0.4 to 1.12 and conda-installed cudatoolkits 10.4 to 11.6. Nvidia prime/optimus works without requiring special Xorg server.

### update 3/28/2020
I have been pursuing using ubuntu 18.04 with nvidia-prime in the ubuntu18.04 branch. This is working using the 4.15 kernel with the latest (post 4.35 nvidia drivers) and patched Xorg. Bumblebee still can work and turn-off the nvidia gpu if I have to run on battery. Performance is excellent and a restart of X is necessary to switch from intel to nvidia and back.

### Update 4/22/2018

- I updated the keyboard firmware yesterday under windows "smart update" utility (FW 3.0.8) and tested a few thousand keypresses and got no double outputs :-) Not sure if the firmware made any difference or if I just sometimes double strike myself on this keyboard and did not do any when i was being careful. 
- Note, at some point, perhaps when I updated to kernel 4.13, I also updated the nvidia drivers to 3.90, from 3.87, working fine with this, added config files to repo to reflect this.

### Update 4/5/2018

 - tried using macbook usb-c adapter to add second display (after failure using builtin HDMI and mini-displayport) and it works right out of the box with lightdm/xubuntu. Works with two brands so far, the first one we are not sure (no label) the second one is the Cable Matters USB-C Multiport adapter with ethernet model 201014-BLK. It suport VGA at 1040p@60Hz and 4k@30Hz via HDMI. The usb port and ethernet port work as well. It uses a DisplayLink chip I think.

### Update 3/2018:

 - updated to kernel 4.13 using ubuntu hwe (4.10 is not receiving security updates) so 4.13-38 is my current one
 - updated cuda as nvidia is now supporting kernel 4.13
 - will add more details but configuration is otherwise similar
 - typical usage for linux is still sometimes touchy:
   - boot to text mode -> startx with nvidia gpu ON (output of cat /proc/acpi/bbswitch) 
   - if operating off battery then use bbswitch (or simply activate bumblebee - sudo service bumblebeed start) to give long battery life
   - works best if manually suspend using sudo pm-suspend or get lockups sometimes; 
     - suspect lid button activating susupend needs to turn gpu back on 
   - work-around: write script gui-start to standardize starting X - make sure nvidia is on before starting, then immediately turn off

### overview of configuration

- initially tried using default xenial repo without virtualgl following instructions here [Ubuntu with Nvidia CUDA Bumblebee](https://hemenkapadia.github.io/blog/2016/11/11/Ubuntu-with-Nvidia-CUDA-Bumblebee.html)
- able to use bbswitch to turn off nvidia and lower battery current draw (with grub modeline workaround)
- primus bridge did not work initially to actually show 3D graphics using nvidia card but with workaround (primus-problem-workaround) by editing the xorg.conf file it is working
- Intel builtin gpu had glmark2 score of 530
- cuda-8* works with tensorflow and pytorch without 3D from nvidia via careful library manipulation and manual modprobe of nvidia* modules
  - nvidia driver 390 now, originally started with 384 (384.111-1) then 387 (387.26-1)


#### adding virtualgl + testing repo for bumblebee

- went ahead and installed all dependencies for virtualgl (a lot!) this time
- now it auto-selects virtualgl bridge and I can see 3D stuff on screen using nvidia card :-)
- glxspheres64 speeds up from 47 Mpixels/s (intel) to 470 Mpixels/sec
- it is still relatively little increase in framerates for benchmarks limited by nvidia->intel bandwidth
  - using proxy (no compression) "optirun glmark2" score after last test is 830 (expected is >2000 for native performance)
  - some of the other tests list some slightly high frame rates/scores. I assume these are somewhat limited by what the intel card and transport can provide.
  - the demos/tests look smooth.
  
#### getting bumblebee+primus to work

- did not work out of the box but with primus-problem-workaround.md adding to xorg.conf.nvidia
  - update 4/1/2018 somewhere after the update to 4.13 hwe I can no longer use primus as the bridge, need to use virtualgl again. 
- that works: Superposition runs (maybe intermittently) on medium setting, 9977; 
  - this is about the same as under Windows a bit lower than under direct X but a bit higher that under OpenGL
- Heaven 2852 OpenGL 1920x1080 8xAA fullscreen High Quality

#### battery life with bumblebee 

- battery life appears pretty great estimates are around 9-10hrs when editing files, running web browser in i3wm.
  - I sometimes run "sudo powertop --auto-tune" to see if I do better and I set the brightness at 20%
  - I make sure that cat /proc/acpi/bbswitch shows that the nvidia is OFF

#### Ongoing minor problems

- keyboard sometime double strikes, that is "aa" instead of "a" -- this seems to be less of a problem as time goes on but it still occurs :-( Happens under windows as well.
 - update: after a firmware update, I think that the keyboard may be ok
- bumblebeed fails when it first tries to start but works fine when started manually
  - this may be working after the update to 4.13
- need to use "light" utility to adjust backlight when in i3 wm because the various Fn+Fx keys are not picked up with the default 105 key keyboard as configured. Not picked up by ev, evtest, or acpi_listen
- the touchpad gets activated a lot when I am typing, making things jump around. Actually helps if I lean my palms onto it. Can turn off touchpad and use mouse for more serious typing (libinput in use)

#### cuda use

- use pytorch 0.3, tensorflow 1.4.1 in conda envs with cuda 8.0
- need to be careful that all the right libraries are on LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CUDA_ROOT is set correctly
- use bin/cuda_on bin/cuda_off to turn on/off nvidia gpu for cuda use on battery power manually
- or use "optirun -b none" to run without any transport for graphical output
- testing cuda 9.0/9.1 - use nvidia "run" file distributions to get these while keeping cuda 8.0 installed as well
  added additional cuda libraries for simulatenous 8.0, 9.0 and 9.1 via ".run" file distribution cuda sdk so as not to interfere with deb based system
