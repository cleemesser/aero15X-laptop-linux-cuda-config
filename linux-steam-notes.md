# Steam/gaming setup
Under windows, this is a pretty good gaming laptop.
It works pretty well under linux using steam and the humble bundle games.

### For ubuntu 22.04.
1. installed Steam deb from the official site.
2. dpkg -i steam_latest.deb
3. sudo apt install --fix-broken
4. nvidia-settings and set the system to Performance Mode to only use the Nvidia GPU in the PRIME Profiles tab,

### Other possible programs to try:
- cpupower-gui for cpupower , to view and set CPU frequencies and Governor (see guide how to install). Or something similar that does the same.

- Gamemoderun , handy tool to auto-switch your CPU Governor when starting an app, it uses cpupower

- Mangohud , for GPU and CPU statistics in games

  - GOverlay , to configure Mangohud

  - VKCube, it should come installed with GOverlay

  - Unigine Heaven , an OpenGL Benchmark/stress test
